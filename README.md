## Getting Started

Before you first run the portfolio:
1. Add your name and group (1NMD, 1CMOe,...) to the `README.md` page
2. Change your first name, last name and group in `data.js`

When you open the portfolio (by opening index.html) you should see you're personalised portfolio!

In the folder `assignments` you can update the necessary files, according to each assignment's requirements.

If you need to change a URL for one of the assignments, you can update them in the `data.js` file.
